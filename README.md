```
Directory of leaves images depends on path where you run your app. 
The directory Folio should be in path 'images/Folio'. 
And bsif filters should be put insisde bsif_filters directory.
Struct of file on my workstation looks:
images/Folio/ashanti blood/...
            /barbados cherry/...
            /caricature plant/...
            /...
bsif_filters/ICAtextureFilters_3x3_5bit.mat
            /ICAtextureFilters_3x3_6bit.mat
            /....
```
